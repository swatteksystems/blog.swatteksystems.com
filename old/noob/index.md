|                          | time.  I was becoming    |                          |
|                          | bored with Windows, not  |                          |
|                          | because I had learned    |                          |
|                          | everything about it, but |                          |
|                          | because I felt that I    |                          |
|                          | had learned all that I   |                          |
|                          | *wanted* to know about   |                          |
|                          | Windows.  Once you've    |                          |

|                          | much else you can do to  |                          |
|                          | really make it your      |                          |
|                          | own.  There are many     |                          |
|                          | applications you can     |                          |
|                          | install, but like a used |                          |
|                          | car, you're stuck "as    |                          |
|                          | is".  I often needed     |                          |
|                          | several different types  |                          |
|                          | of the same app (ex. 3   |                          |

|                          | to enjoy the various     |                          |
|                          | files I had in my        |                          |
|                          | library, which really    |                          |
|                          | started to bog down my   |                          |

|                          | one day, I got to        |                          |

|                          | I had heard of Linux,    |                          |
|                          | but always assumed it    |                          |
|                          | was for users much more  |                          |

|                          | Linux is not only more   |                          |
|                          | user friendly, more      |                          |

|                          | change is scary, so this |                          |
|                          | was a way to ease me     |                          |

|                          | no-brainer, and it is.   |                          |
|                          | I had sent my laptop     |                          |
|                          | away for repairs the     |                          |
|                          | month previous (thanks   |                          |
|                          | to a Vista Service Pack  |                          |
|                          | upgrade, ugh) and had    |                          |
|                          | backed everything up     |                          |
|                          | then, so I wasn't as     |                          |

|                          | have been, and decided I |                          |
|                          | could probably risk it.  |                          |
|                          | Yeah, not hard to see    |                          |
|                          | where this is going, is  |                          |
|                          | it?  Although the        |                          |

|                          | they walk you through    |                          |

|                          | chose to **overwrite**   |                          |

|                          | it up as a dual-boot.    |                          |
|                          | That's right,            |                          |

|                          | Well Tony, it could be   |                          |
|                          | worse...she could be     |                          |
|                          | running Vista ;P\        |                          |

|                          | What does she primarily  |                          |
|                          | use her computer for?    |                          |
|                          | If, like me, it's mostly |                          |
|                          | just a toy and not       |                          |
|                          | something she uses for   |                          |
|                          | work, try having her     |                          |
|                          | check out the Ubuntu or  |                          |
|                          | Kubuntu websites, which  |                          |
|                          | are extremely user       |                          |
|                          | friendly. I know for     |                          |
|                          | myself, fear of the      |                          |
|                          | unknown was the biggest  |                          |
|                          | stumbling block to get   |                          |
|                          | over, so if she can see  |                          |
|                          | how accessible Linux is, |                          |
|                          | most of her fears may be |                          |
|                          | put to rest. Plus,       |                          |
|                          | dual-booting always      |                          |
|                          | gives her a chance to go |                          |
|                          | back to XP if she ends   |                          |
|                          | up hating Linux. Of      |                          |
|                          | course, you could always |                          |
|                          | wipe winblows from her   |                          |
|                          | computer altogether, but |                          |
|                          | that may put you in the  |                          |
