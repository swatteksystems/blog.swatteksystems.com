        <div class="plain">
<p>So I mentioned in my last post that I would expand on the Magnatune
tab within the Amarok player once I had a chance to play with it.&nbsp; This
was easier said than done, as I was experiencing some buggy behaviour
with respect to *some* of my audio output.&nbsp; And before you ask, yes,
the first thing I checked was the volume ;)&nbsp; Being a recovering
winblows user, I fell back on the only real solution that seemed to
"fix" anything in the microsoft world: reboot, (or in this case,
restart).&nbsp; This did occasionally fix the issue, but never for long.&nbsp;
Then, my Unix tutor explained to me that I was running Gnome, and
Amarok was a KDE app.&nbsp; Although KDE apps can run in Gnome, there may be
some minor issues.&nbsp; So, with some help I installed KDE, set it as
default and have had no problems since.&nbsp; One thing I was very happy
about was that even though I had changed from Gnome to KDE, nothing on
my system had changed.&nbsp; Of course, my tutor had told me this would be
the case, but being a former zombie in Gates' army, I could not fathom
how everything would remain the same.&nbsp; Kinda like trying to explain
snow to someone who has never left Cuba.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a id="nl4w" class="external-link" href="https://www.magnatune.com/">Magnatune</a>'s&nbsp; claim is that they "are not evil".&nbsp; They expand on
this tag-line by explaining that they "work directly with independent
musicians world-wide to give you downloads of MP3's and perfect-quality
WAV files.&nbsp; We never work with major labels, and our musicians always
get 50%.&nbsp; You can listen to every album in it's entirety before buying
or becoming a member".&nbsp; Pretty awesome.&nbsp; On it's own, Magnatune is a
really good place to not only find new music (and some music videos),
but to help support the up and coming bands that you think deserve it.&nbsp;
The magic happens when you team it up with Amarok.&nbsp; Based on your music
preferences, the Magnatune tab within Amarok suggests artists in every
genre that you may like.&nbsp; It gives you multiple artists, some of them
with multiple albums, and allows you to add them directly to your
current playlist.&nbsp; I'm not talking a 30 second preview of each song,
either.&nbsp; Complete tracks on what I assume are complete albums.&nbsp; For
example, when I chose the genre metal, I was given six different
artists, and the shortest album contained 7 songs.&nbsp; Now, at the end of
each song a voice tells you the track number, band name, album, and
that you can buy it at magnatune.com.&nbsp; I don't find this to be a
problem at all, as it's about a 10 second message, and I get to listen
to each song in it's entirety.&nbsp; Sure, it may mess up the flow of an
album, but still, who cares?&nbsp; After all, this is <u>free</u>.&nbsp; Also
included in the Magnatune tab within Amarok is a bio on the artist, as
well as album covers, but my favourite part about being able to add each
track into my playlist is that I can rate each one.&nbsp; Now, I won't go
into how much I love the 10 star rating system again, (I really love
it), but in this case it is especially useful.&nbsp; You see, I have 99
metal tracks to listen to, by 6 different artists.&nbsp; I am currently
listening to them in the background as I type this, occasionally
switching over to rate the current song, (enjoying "Siamese Suicide"
off of The Citadel by Heir to Madness right now).&nbsp; This way, even if it
takes me a week or more to get through every album, I can look back and
see at a glance which artists I particularly enjoyed, and then I can
purchase albums by those artists, knowing that 50% of the cost is going
directly to the band, and not getting eaten up by their label.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
An interesting <a id="v6sp" class="external-link" href="https://magnatune.com/info/press/coverage/usa_today">article </a>featured in USA Today about Magnatune quotes founder John Buckman
as saying, "We want to be the Linux of the music world".&nbsp; He is
referring to the fact that contracts with artists allow for a certain
kind of sharing of their music allowing users to "take it apart,
improve on it, and use it to make something new" essentially making it
open source.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
So, in the time it has taken me to write this blog
entry and peruse the Magnatune website, I've listened to three artists,
Heir to Madness (alright), Mandrake Root (couldn't even make it through
the whole album), and Pain Factor, an artist I will be supporting for
sure.&nbsp; Excuse me while I fetch my credit card.&nbsp; :)</div>

          <p class="documentDescription">Music has always played an important part in Nicole's life, and in the next few entries she'll be discussing music player Amarok.</p>
        

        
        <div class="plain">
<p>One thing that worried me when I first installed Ubuntu was that I
would be forced to learn how to use the CLI, Command Line Interface.&nbsp;
If you're unfamiliar with this, it looks a lot like DOS, where you are
given a prompt and must input a command that you want the computer to
run.&nbsp; Having been enslaved by Microsoft from an early age, I have not
learned to communicate in this specific language.&nbsp; I'm all about the
point and click...like a lab monkey trained to identify the red ball
from the pile.&nbsp; My worries were unfounded, however, as all the apps
I've come across to date are customizable from their respective
"settings" tabs, exactly as they would be in Winblows.&nbsp; This was
important for me, specifically when it came to the app I use most
often, music player <a class="external-link" href="https://amarok.kde.org/">Amarok</a>.<br /><br />If you read <a class="external-link" href="windows-users-anonymous">my first post</a>, you'll
know that I wiped windows from my system completely.&nbsp; Now, even though
I had my music collection on the back-up disks I had made of Winblows,
it seemed like it would be a hassle to try and extract those without
re-installing the entire O/S, at least at my level.&nbsp; So, once Amarok was installed I plugged my iPod (which thankfully contains the
majority of my music library) into my USB port and crossed my fingers
that Amarok would recognize it.&nbsp; Not only did Amarok recognize it (and
immediately begin playing my music), but I was able to take the files
from my iPod and copy them to my Music folder on my hard drive,
something that I had heard was tricky running winblows/iTunes, (though,
admittedly, I've never tried it, it could be very straightforward).<br /><br />At
first (very quick) glance, Amarok appears to be similar to iTunes,
specifically with respect to the playlist layout.&nbsp; Then it gets much
better.&nbsp; Along the left hand side, you have several options right off
the bat.&nbsp; <strong>Context</strong>, which I usually leave up, allows you to toggle
between Music, Lyrics (!!!), and Artist.&nbsp; The latter automatically
fetches information for the artist currently playing from
www.wikipedia.org, Lyrics allows you to sing along with your favorite
tune using a variety of databases, but the simply named Music tab is
the most useful, (as much as I <em>do</em> love singing along).&nbsp; It
displays the title and artist of the current track, along with a
counter telling you the number of times you've listened to that track,
albums by that artist including the track listings, and displays
similar artists and suggested songs from your library, each scored
based on your listening history.&nbsp; And if you rate the song (more on
that later) you're listening to, the suggestions for both songs and
artists will change accordingly to more precisely match your
preferences.&nbsp; As well, it allows you to enter a tag for the song
currently playing.&nbsp; Aren't familiar with tagging your music?&nbsp; Type
whatever word you like that describes the current song, and Amarok will
keep track.&nbsp; At this point, I'm still trying to figure out how to load
a playlist based on tags, so that when I'm in a specific mood, I can
type "metal" and have all tracks I've previously tagged that way
populate the playlist, but I'll write about that when I figure it out.<br />
<br />
The other options on the left include <strong>Collection</strong>, (which lists your
entire music collection by artist), <strong>Files</strong>, <strong>Devices</strong>, (for your external
players, such as an iPod), <strong>Playlists</strong>, and <strong>Magnatune</strong>, which I'm still
playing with and will elaborate on in another post.<br />
<br />
As for the rating option, anyone who has used iTunes in the past, (and
I feel your pain) will be familiar with the 5 star rating.&nbsp; Amarok
doubles your fun, allowing you 10 different ratings to further
distinguish between, "man, this is a really good tune", and "OMFG I
LOVE THIS SONG!".&nbsp; Now, to a lot of people this isn't really a big
deal, but I was pretty excited when I found it, as one of my (many)
complaints about iTunes was that 5 stars just isn't enough to cover the
many different levels of how much I like a song. In Amarok, once you
click in the appropriate spot for the desired track, moving your cursor
will highlight between one and five stars.&nbsp; If you highlight then
click, say, 4 then all you have to do is click the 4th star and it will
shrink, essentially giving that track 3.5 stars.&nbsp; Hovering over ratings
will give you a text description of the rating, in the previous
example, "Very Good".&nbsp; Rated the wrong track?&nbsp; Just click on the first
star once to shrink it, and a second time to erase it.<br />

          <p class="documentDescription">Transitioning to Linux, through a n00b's eyes.</p>
        

        
        <div class="plain">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hello, my name is Nicole, and I'm a recovering Windows user.<br /><br />&nbsp;I would never refer to myself as a computer expert.&nbsp; Intermediate user maybe, or slightly above n00b...<u>most</u>
of the time.&nbsp; I was becoming bored with Windows, not because I had
learned everything about it, but because I felt that I had learned all
that I <em>wanted</em> to know about Windows.&nbsp; Once you've got the
preferences set up the way you'd like them, there really isn't much
else you can do to really make it your own.&nbsp; There are many
applications you can install, but like a used car, you're stuck "as
is".&nbsp; I often needed several different types of the same app (ex. 3
different movie players) to enjoy the various files I had in my
library, which really started to bog down my speed and fill up my hard
drive.<br /><br />However, like the <a class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix">masses plugged into the matrix unaware</a>,
I simply continued to plod along, not really satisfied but not
confident enough to upgrade my system.&nbsp; Then one day, I got to talking
with Steven about Linux.&nbsp; Of course, I had heard of Linux, but always
assumed it was for users much more experienced than I.&nbsp; After
explaining how Linux is not only more user friendly, more customizable,
but much more secure than Windows, he convinced me to load <a class="external-link" href="https://ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a>, a noob version of Linux onto my system in a dual-boot format,
allowing me to keep Windows as well.&nbsp; He was pretty confident I
wouldn't go back even given the choice, but change is scary, so this
was a way to ease me into it.<br /><br />Now, as I've stated above, I've
never thought of myself as an expert, but I know just enough about
computers to get myself in trouble.&nbsp; So please, learn from my mistake and before you do anything,
take the time to back up your system!&nbsp; Sounds like a no-brainer, and it
is.&nbsp; I had sent my laptop away for repairs the month previous (thanks
to a Vista Service Pack upgrade, ugh) and had backed everything up
then, so I wasn't as diligent as I should have been, and decided I
could probably risk it.&nbsp; Yeah, not hard to see where this is going, is
it?&nbsp; Although the installation process is very user friendly, and they
walk you through each step, I wasn't paying as close attention as I
should have been (yay multitasking!).&nbsp; When it came time to decide how
to partition my hard drive I inadvertently chose to <strong>overwrite</strong> Windows, rather than set it up as a dual-boot.&nbsp; That's right, everything, gone.<br /><br />So
after a brief moment of nauseousness, and some reassurance that at
most, I had lost a month's worth of data, I decided there was no other
option but to plunge ahead into Ubuntu.<br /><br />I have to say, Steven
was right.&nbsp; Even if I had the chance to go back to Windows, (and
technically, I still have that old backup) I wouldn't.&nbsp; Everything you
need to get started with Ubuntu is transparently available, from the
simplified toolbars to the various applications you start out with.&nbsp;
Open Office, Linux's sleek response to Microsoft's various word/data
processing applications has no problem opening any of my old files and
is intuitively easy to use.&nbsp; Quite the improvement over the frustration
encountered when I would try to edit a document at home as well as at
work, using different version of Windows.&nbsp; The Preferences tab allows
you to tweak everything about your system so that it is *exactly* the
way you want it.&nbsp; Curious about what other types of applications you
can play with?&nbsp; Check out the Synaptic Package Manager under the Administration tab, a "store" where you can browse hundreds of
applications accompanied by both a short description and a more
detailed one (just highlight your choice).&nbsp; I haven't even been using
Ubuntu a week, and already I've downloaded and installed approximately
400 of them.&nbsp; Oh, and the best part about installing new apps?&nbsp; No
reboot necessary.&nbsp; That's right, just start using it!&nbsp; Some of my
current favorite apps, which I'll talk about later are music player <a id="tjm5" title="Amarok" href="https://amarok.kde.org/" target="_blank">Amarok</a>, instant messenger <a id="iva." title="aMSN" href="https://www.amsn-project.net/" target="_blank">aMSN</a>, and of course, the many, many games available.&nbsp; What makes these apps so amazing?&nbsp; So much better than <em>anything</em>
Microsoft has to offer?&nbsp; Why, the fact that they are open-source, of
course!&nbsp; If you know how to do some programming, not only can you modify
any app to do anything you like, you're encouraged to!&nbsp; If you're like
me, and have no programming experience at all, every app I've come
across has a help menu that gives you sites or email addresses to
report bugs or to offer recommendations/requests specific to that app.&nbsp;
Plus, there are many, many online forums full of users that can answer
questions, make recommendations, and generally help you troubleshoot
any app, on any version of Linux you're running.&nbsp; From <a id="e3ro" class="external-link" href="https://linuxforums.org">Linux Forums</a> to&nbsp;<a id="mu5h" title="Ubuntu help" href="https://www.ubuntu.com/support" target="_blank">Ubuntu support</a>
and everything in between.&nbsp; Just Google the name of the app you're
curious about and the word "help" and you'll have no problem finding
someone to get you where you want to go.<br /><br />So yes, I am a recovering Windows addict, but one day at a time, my computer just keeps getting better :)</p>

                <div class="commentBody">Well Tony, it could be worse...she could be running Vista ;P<br /><br />What does she primarily use her computer for?  If, like me, it's mostly just a toy and not something she uses for work, try having her check out the Ubuntu or Kubuntu websites, which are extremely user friendly.  I know for myself, fear of the unknown was the biggest stumbling block to get over, so if she can see how accessible Linux is, most of her fears may be put to rest.  Plus, dual-booting always gives her a chance to go back to XP if she ends up hating Linux.  Of course, you could always wipe winblows from her computer altogether, but that may put you in the doghouse for a bit, lol.<br /><br />Thanks for the good wishes,<br />Nicole</div>
