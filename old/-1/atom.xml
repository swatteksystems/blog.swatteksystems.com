<h2 align="left">Know your System Administrator</h2>
<p>
                                               (a field guide)</p>
<p>

There are four major species of Unix sysad:</p>
<p>
 1.The <strong>TECHNICAL THUG</strong>. Usually a systems programmer who has been forced
into system administration; writes scripts in a polyglot of the Bourne shell,
sed, C, awk, perl, and APL.</p>
<p>
 2.The <strong>ADMINISTRATIVE FASCIST</strong>. Usually a retentive drone (or rarely, a
harridan ex-secretary) who has been forced into system administration.</p>
<p>
 3.The <strong>MANIAC</strong>. Usually an aging cracker who discovered that neither the
Mossad nor Cuba are willing to pay a living wage for computer 
espionage. Fell into system administration; occasionally approaches 
major competitors with indesp schemes.</p>
<p>
 4.The <strong>IDIOT</strong>. Usually a cretin, morpohodite, or old COBOL programmer
selected to be the system administrator by a committee of cretins, 
morphodites, and old COBOL programmers.</p>
<h3>HOW TO IDENTIFY YOUR SYSTEM ADMINISTRATOR:</h3>
<h3>SITUATION:</h3>
Low disk space.
<h3>TECHNICAL THUG:</h3>
Writes a suite of scripts to monitor disk usage,
maintain a database of historic disk usage, predict future disk 
usage via least squares regression analysis, identify users
who are more than a standard deviation over the mean, and send mail to
the offending parties.  Places script in cron. Disk usage does not 
change, since disk-hogs, by nature, either ignore
script-generated mail, or file it away in triplicate.
<h3>ADMINISTRATIVE FASCIST:</h3>
Puts disk usage policy in motd. Uses disk
quotas. Allows no exceptions, thus crippling development work. 
Locks accounts that go over quota.
<h3>MANIAC:</h3>
# cd /home
        # rm -rf `du -s * | sort -rn | head -1 | awk '{print $2}'`;
<h3>IDIOT:</h3>
# cd /home
        # cat `du -s * | sort -rn | head -1 | awk '{ printf "%s/*\n", $2}'` | compress
<h3>SITUATION:</h3>
Excessive CPU usage
<h3>TECHNICAL THUG:</h3>
Writes a suite of scripts to monitor processes, maintain
a database of CPU usage, identify processes more than a standard 
deviation over the norm, and renice offending
processes. Places script in cron. Ends up renicing the production
database into oblivion, bringing operations to a grinding halt, 
much to the delight of the xtrek freaks.
<h3>ADMINISTRATIVE FASCIST:</h3>
Puts CPU usage policy in motd. Uses CPU quotas.
Locks accounts that go over quota. Allows no exceptions, thus crippling
development work, much to the delight of the xtrek freaks.
<h3>MANIAC:</h3>
# kill -9 `ps -augxww | sort -rn +8 -9  | head -1 | awk '{print $2}'`
<h3>IDIOT:</h3>
# compress -f `ps -augxww | sort -rn +8 -9  | head -1 | awk '{print $2}'`
<h3>SITUATION:</h3>
New account creation.
<h3>TECHNICAL THUG:</h3>
Writes perl script that creates home directory, copies
in incomprehensible default environment, and places entries in 
/etc/passwd, /etc/shadow, and /etc/group. (By hand,
NOT with passmgmt.) Slaps on setuid bit; tells a nearby secretary to
handle new accounts. Usually, said secretary is still dithering over 
the difference between 'enter' and 'return'; and so, no new
accounts are ever created.
<h3>ADMINISTRATIVE FASCIST:</h3>
Puts new account policy in motd. Since people
without accounts cannot read the motd, nobody ever fulfills the 
bureaucratic requirements; and so, no new accounts are ever created.
<h3>MANIAC:</h3>
"If you're too stupid to break in and create your own account, I
don't want you on the system. We've got too many goddamn sh*t-for-brains 
a**holes on this box anyway."
<h3>IDIOT:</h3>
# cd /home; mkdir "Bob's home directory"
    # echo "Bob Simon:gandalf:0:0::/dev/tty:compress -f" &gt; /etc/passwd
<h3>SITUATION:</h3>
Root disk fails
<h3>TECHNICAL THUG:</h3>
Repairs drive. Usually is able to repair filesystem from
boot monitor. Failing that, front-panel toggles microkernel in and 
starts script on neighboring machine to load binary
boot code into broken machine, reformat and reinstall OS. Lets it run
over the weekend while he goes mountain climbing.
<h3>ADMINISTRATIVE FASCIST:</h3>
Begins investigation to determine who broke the
drive. Refuses to fix system until culprit is identified and charged 
for the equipment.
<h3>MANIAC, LARGE SYSTEM:</h3>
Rips drive from system, uses sledgehammer to smash
same to flinders. Calls manufacturer, threatens pets. Abuses field 
engineer while they put in a new drive and reinstall the OS.
<h3>MANIAC, SMALL SYSTEM:</h3>
Rips drive from system, uses ball-peen hammer to
smash same to flinders. Calls Requisitions, threatens pets. Abuses 
bystanders while putting in new drive and reinstalling OS.
<h3>IDIOT:</h3>
Doesn't notice anything wrong.
<h3>SITUATION:</h3>
Poor network response.
<h3>TECHNICAL THUG:</h3>
Writes scripts to monitor network, then rewires entire
machine room, improving response time by 2%. Shrugs shoulders, says, 
"I've done all I can do," and goes mountain climbing.
<h3>ADMINISTRATIVE FASCIST:</h3>
Puts network usage policy in motd. Calls up
Berkeley and AT&amp;T, badgers whoever answers for network quotas. Tries 
to get xtrek freaks fired.
<h3>MANIAC:</h3>
Every two hours, pulls ethernet cable from wall and waits for
connections to time out.
<h3>IDIOT:</h3>
# compress -f /dev/en0
<h3>SITUATION:</h3>

questions.  Doesn't bother to tell people how to start the new 
"guru-mode", or for that matter, emacs.
<h3>ADMINISTRATIVE FASCIST:</h3>
Puts user support policy in motd. Maintains
queue of questions.  Answers them when he gets a chance, often 
within two weeks of receipt of the proper form.
<h3>MANIAC:</h3>
Screams at users until they go away. Sometimes barters knowledge
for powerful drink and/or sycophantic adulation.
<h3>IDIOT:</h3>
Answers all questions to best of his knowledge until the user
realizes few Unix systems support punched cards or JCL.
<h3>Stupid user questions</h3>
<h3>TECHNICAL THUG:</h3>
Answers question in hex, binary, postfix, and/or French
until user gives up and goes away.
<h3>ADMINISTRATIVE FASCIST:</h3>
Locks user's account until user can present
documentation demonstrating their qualification to use the machine.
<h3>MANIAC:</h3>
# cat &gt; &gt; ~luser/.cshrc
    alias vi 'rm \!*;unalias vi;grep -v BoZo ~/.cshrc &gt; ~/.z; mv -f ~/.z ~/.cshrc'
    ^D
<h3>IDIOT:</h3>
Answers all questions to best of his knowledge. Recruits user to
system administration team.
<h3>SITUATION:</h3>
Process accounting management
<h3>TECHNICAL THUG:</h3>
Ignores packaged accounting software; trusts scripts to
sniff out any problems &amp; compute charges.
<h3>ADMINISTRATIVE FASCIST:</h3>
Devotes 75% of disk space to accounting records
owned by root and chmod'ed 000.
<h3>MANIAC:</h3>
Laughs fool head off at very mention of accounting.
<h3>IDIOT:</h3>
# lpr /etc/wtmp /usr/adm/paact
<h3>SITUATION:</h3>
Religious war, BSD vs. System V
<h3>TECHNICAL THUG:</h3>
BSD. Crippled on System V boxes.
<h3>ADMINISTRATIVE FASCIST:</h3>
System V. Horrified by the people who use BSD.
Places frequent calls to DEA.
<h3>MANIAC:</h3>
Prefers BSD, but doesn't care as long as HIS processes run
quickly.
<h3>IDIOT:</h3>
# cd c:
<h3>SITUATION:</h3>
Religious war, System V vs. AIX
<h3>TECHNICAL THUG:</h3>
Weeps.
<h3>ADMINISTRATIVE FASCIST:</h3>
AIX-- doesn't much care for the OS, but loves
the jackboots.
<h3>MANIAC:</h3>
System V, but keeps AIX skills up, knowing full well how much
Big Financial Institutions love IBM...
<h3>IDIOT:</h3>
AIX.
<h3>SITUATION:</h3>
Balky printer daemons.
<h3>TECHNICAL THUG:</h3>
Rewrites lpd in FORTH.
<h3>ADMINISTRATIVE FASCIST:</h3>
Puts printer use policy in motd. Calls customer
support every time the printer freezes. Tries to get user who submitted 
the most recent job fired.
<h3>MANIAC:</h3>
Writes script that kills all the daemons, clears all the print
queues, and maybe restarts the daemons. Runs it once a hour from cron.
<h3>IDIOT:</h3>
# kill -9 /dev/lp ; /dev/lp &amp;
<h3>SITUATION:</h3>
OS upgrade
<h3>TECHNICAL THUG:</h3>
Reads source code of new release, takes only what he
likes.
<h3>ADMINISTRATIVE FASCIST:</h3>
Instigates lawsuit against the vendor for having
shipped a product with bugs in it in the first place.
<h3>MANIAC:</h3>
# uptime
    1:33pm  up 19 days, 22:49,  167 users,  load average: 6.49, 6.45,
6.31
    # wall
    Well, it's upgrade time.  Should take a few hours.  And good luck on
that 5:00 deadline, guys!  We're all pulling for you!

SNOBOL. Hacks kernel to implement file locking. Hacks kernel to 
implement "better" semaphores. Rewrites sendmail in assembly. Hacks 
kernel to . . .
<h3>ADMINISTRATIVE FASCIST:</h3>
Puts mail use policy in motd. Locks accounts
that go over mail use quota. Keeps quota low enough that people go 
back to interoffice mail, thus solving problem.
<h3>MANIAC:</h3>
# kill -9 `ps -augxww | grep sendmail | awk '{print $2}'`
    # rm -f /usr/spool/mail/*
    # wall
    Mail is down.  Please use interoffice mail until we have it back up.

<p>There IS a driver in development which provides _some_ functionality and performs with AMSN. Following is a brief how-to.</p>
<pre>lsusb | grep 0402:5602 (should provide output like so: Bus 003 Device 002: ID 0402:5602 ALi Corp. Video Camera Controller
)

You will now create/pull the svn repo now:

svn co httpss://m560x-driver.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/m560x-driver m560x-driver ; cd m560x-driver/m560x/branches/m5602 ;
make ; sudo make install ; modprobe m5602

Now proceed with the AMSN video/audio configuration assistant, reduce the brightness setting to alleviate the jumpiness and you're done!
